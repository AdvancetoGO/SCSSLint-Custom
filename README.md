# SCSS Lint Custom
A custom lint for scss_lint.

## Getting Started
Install all dependencies as normal
```
$ bundle install
```

Execute tests as you develop with
```
$ guard
```

Before submitting a PR run all tests with
```
$ rspec spec/
```

And make sure you comply with the community style guide by running
```
$ rubocop
```

You can run a console for an interactive prompt that will allow you
to experiment.
```
$ bin/console
```


## Installation
You can install the gem manually by running
```
$ gem install rubocop-eql
```
Or add it to your Gemfile
```ruby
gem 'rubocop-eql', github: 'AdvancetoGO/Rubocop-Eql'
```


## Usage
To use the cops along with the default cops, add the following to `.rubocop.yml`

```
require: rubocop-eql
```


## Project Structure

* `config/default.yml` - Default parameters for the cops.
* `lib/rubocop-eql.rb` - Entry point for the extension, with all requires.
* `lib/rubocop/eql/inject.rb` - Monkeypatch for RuboCop to accept a plugin
structure.
* `lib/rubocop/cop/*` - Cops definitions.
